                    The ideation phase focused on developing design concepts that addressed the shortcomings of existing interactive websites. 
                    The goal was to create a website that provided an immersive horror experience while ensuring ease of use and user-friendliness. 
                    <br><br>
                    To achieve this, the following design concepts were developed: 
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside">
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">Simple Navigation: The website's navigation would be simple, intuitive, and easy to use. This would ensure users could quickly access the content they were interested in, reducing cognitive effort and frustration.</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">Interactive Elements: The website would incorporate interactive elements, such as animations and sound effects, to enhance the user's horror experience. These elements would be seamlessly integrated into the website's human interface, providing a seamless experience. </li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">Responsive Design: The website would have a responsive design, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This would ensure people could access the website on any device, improving accessibility.</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">User Testing: The website would undergo user testing to identify and address any usability issues. This would ensure the website's user experience was optimized, reducing frustration and increasing retention rates.</li>

                <p>
                    The next step was to create wireframes to visualize the website's layout and structure which were done on paper. The wireframes showed the website's structure, layout, and functionality based on the research findings and aimed to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for people. 
                    <br><br>
                    We made sure every screen of the website answered the following questions which will improve how intuitive the website is:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-outside">
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">Where am I?</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">Where can I go?</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">What will I find when I get there?</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">How do I get there?</li>
                    <li class="ml-5 mb-3">How do I leave here?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    How do I leave here? Figma was the preferred tool for the design of the website. 
                    The Horror Vault website's overall design is scary and immersive with a black and red color scheme, clear typography, and easy navigation. 
                    The use of sound effects, Gifs, and videos creates a creepy atmosphere for an interactive horror experience. 
                    Progressive Disclosure was incorporated during the mobile design of the vault to reduce clutter.
