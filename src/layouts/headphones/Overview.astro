                No matter how interesting an activity may be, no one enjoys stress.
                And to avoid stress would be like trying to do a vigorous exercise without sweating; 
                but that’s exactly what we tried to do with the headphones.<br/><br>
                Everything about the design is focused on delivering incredible sound and comfort with enhanced simplicity.<br><br>
                As part of a research development in the headphone market, we discovered some interesting finds as regards to peoples’ needs. 
                With these, we were able to determine a common volume and this was our starting point for developing a brand to meet a broad range of needs
